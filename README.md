# Welcome to the EVPN Workshop at NANOG 92
This README is your starting point into the hands on section.

Pre-requisite: A laptop with SSH client

If you need help, please raise your hand and a Nokia team member will be happy to assist.

## Lab Environment

A Nokia team member will provide you with a card that contains:
- your group and VM ID
- SSH credentials to the VM instance
- URL of this repo

> <p style="color:red">!!! Make sure to backup any code, config, ... <u> offline (e.g on your laptop)</u>. 
> The VM instances might be destroyed once the Workshop is concluded.</p>

# Workshop
The objective of the handson section of this workshop is the following:
- Build a DC fabric with leaf and spine
- Build Layer 2 EVPN
- Build Layer 3 EVPN

## Lab Topology

## NOS (Network Operating System)

Both leafs and Spine nodes will be running Nokia [SRLinux](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ip-networks/service-router-linux-NOS/).

## Deploying the lab

After logging into the VM (using the credentials on your card), use the below command to clone this repo to your VM.

```
git clone 
```

Verify that this git repo files are now available on your VM.

```
ls -lrt
```

To deploy the lab, run the following:

```
sudo clab deploy -t 
```

[Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) will deploy the lab and display a table with the list of nodes and their IPs.

To display current deployed labs at any time, use:

```
sudo clab inspect --all
```

## Connecting to the devices

Find the nodename or IP address of the device and then use SSH.
Username: admin
Password: <refer to the card>

```
ssh admin@clab-srl-evpn-leaf1
```

To login to the client, identify the client hostname using the `clab inspect` command above and then:

```
sudo docker exec â€“it clab-srl-evpn-client3 sh
```
